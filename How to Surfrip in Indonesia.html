            <p>Hello, my name is Adam. I traveled through Indonesia for 5 months and visited over 50 surf spots. I wanted to check out as many Surf Locations as possible before my visa ran out . During that time I learned a lot of things the hard way and I had a hard time, to travel on a small budged.
            Therefore I present you all you all you need to know for a cheap surf trip to Indonesia and why it is the best to travel by bus. </p>
