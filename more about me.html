            <h2>From Savings Account to Southeast Asia: My Unexpected Journey to Financial Freedom</h2>
            <p class="post-date">Published: May 16, 2024</p>
            
            <p>
                Hey everyone, I'm Hannes, and at 20 years old, I've already achieved something most people only dream of: financial freedom. 
                But it wasn't stocks or crypto that got me there (maybe a little ðŸ˜‰) â€“ it was something far more simple. 
                And that newfound freedom? It launched me on a two-year adventure through Asia and Australia that changed my life.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ever since I was a kid, I've been a big dreamer. I had a bucket list with over 100 goals, and I knew that money would be a major factor in achieving many of them. 
                So, I started researching ways to reach financial independence as quickly as possible. That's when I started my training at the bank and stumbled upon the concept of frugalism. 
                If you're not familiar with it, it's basically about minimizing your expenses and maximizing your savings rate (but there's a lot more to it, so check out my post 
                <a href="what-is-frugalism-for-me.html">What is Frugalism for Me?</a> if you're curious!).
            </p>
            
            <h2>Fast Forward to Freedom</h2>
            <p>
                After just 3.5 years working at a bank, I was able to embark on my long-awaited journey to Southeast Asia.
                Now, you might think I won the lottery or struck gold with crypto. But what if I told you that I didn't need to be a millionaire to feel financially free? 
                Don't get me wrong, I saved up a decent amount and had some luck on the stock market, but it wouldn't have been enough to last a lifetime without working again.
            </p>

            <p>
                That's where my definition of financial freedom comes in. It's not about endless riches and not having to work anymore; it's about having the ability to pursue your passions without constantly worrying about money. 
                For me, those passions turned out to be flow art, yoga, and DJingâ€”not exactly the most lucrative career choices (yet!). 
                But by working hard for 3.5 years and embracing a frugal lifestyle, I saved enough to live life on my own terms, not society's. 
                If you want to learn why I think the German "Ausbildung" is the best way to achieve all this, check out my article

            </p>
            
            <p>I wasn't planning on blogging about this at first. There are already so many travel blogs out there. But after a few months, I realized that my experiences were too valuable not to share. I wanted to show others that this kind of freedom is attainable, even without a massive bank account.</p>

            <p>Over the course of my travels, I visited 11 countries, explored over 100 destinations, and covered more than 35,000 kilometers (almost) only by bus and ferry (that's right, no flights for me!). Sustainable travel was a big priority, and I learned a ton about how to minimize my environmental impact while still having an amazing time. If you want to learn more about that, check out my article <a href="how-to-travel-sustainable-in-asia.html">How to Travel Sustainably in Asia</a>.</p>


            <h2>My Mission: Solar-Powered Hostels</h2>

            <p>But there was one thing that mattered to me even more than sustainability: finding the best hostels in Southeast Asia. I knew I didn't want to spend my life in cold, dreary Germany; I wanted to live on beautiful beaches where I could surf and kitesurf. To make that dream a reality and give back to the environment at the same time, I decided to start installing solar panels on all of my favorite hostels.</p>
